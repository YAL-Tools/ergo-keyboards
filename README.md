# YAL's ergo keyboard list

This is a collection of column-staggered and ortholinear ergonomic keyboards.

It is not as large as some other collections¹, but you can sort and filter the keyboards.  
¹ As far as I can tell, the collection now (Nov 2023)
covers most medium..big column-staggered keyboards
and has a fair sample of smaller ones that have interesting features/geometry.

## Adding keyboards (GUI)

You can find a visual editor on the bottom of the
[web version](https://yal-tools.github.io/ergo-keyboards/).

When you're done filling out information about the keyboard,
you can check how it looks by pressing Test
(which adds/updates it at the bottom of the list),
then press Generate JSON, and either
[create an issue](https://github.com/YAL-Tools/ergo-keyboards/issues)
or [send it to me elsewhere](https://yal.cc/about/).

Tech-savvy users can also fork the repository,
add the new keyboard to `docs/keyboards.js`,
add its photo to `docs/img` (try to keep it below 1280x960 / 350KB),
and submit a pull request.

If you have ImageMagick installed, you might run `create-small.bat` (Windows) or `create-small.sh` (Linux; untested on Mac)
in `docs/` to generate the smaller WEBPs that are used for "Table with images" and "Gallery" display modes.
Otherwise I will do so after merging the PR - no biggie.

## Building

You'll need [Haxe](https://haxe.org) installed.

Open a terminal/Command Prompt/PowerShell/whatever in the directory
(on Windows, this is done by shift-right-clicking an empty spot in Explorer),
type the following, and press Enter

```
haxe build.hxml
```

If Haxe is installed and all is well, docs/script.js will be updated.

### Building stylesheets

You'll need NodeJS and less installed. Nodemon is optional, but recommended for live reloading the changes.

Run the command: `nodemon --exec lessc .\src\styles\styles.less .\docs\style.css`

This will update the style.css whenever you make a change in any `.less` file.
